<h1>Reading 1 Sontag</h1>
 <p> In Plato’s Cave, Chapter 1, Sontag describes photography in many ways. It seems and can be a beautiful and fun thing, but it also can be used against people. 
I believe photographs can show beautiful moments and sometimes “say” more than words, but I agree that it is not really reality.
A picture can appear as many things, but the reality of the people or event in the picture you can’t really know unless you were present in that moment. Someone can see a picture and think you look the happiest you ever have when, in reality, it could have been your worst day. 
It is becoming more and more shared with social media. Many people who share their lives online would probably say that what they post is not their reality but just the best or the most curated moments of their lives.
Photographs also being used against people or in a way to hurt them is not right but is the reality of the world. People can use photos for blackmail, edit pictures into something bad, stalking, etc.
Even if you don’t consent to being in it, you can still be captured in photos, even without knowing, same as with video now.
Even for mental health, photos can be bad. Seeing vacations, experiences, people having fun, perfect bodies, and perfect lives can change people’s views completely. But people really only usually share the good things, the cute photos. Not the things that are tough and unpleasant. You wouldn’t have any way of knowing if it’s staged or candid, if there was arguing going on, or if someone just went through a tragedy.
Photos can show and make you feel a lot, but the truth is that you never really know the situation behind the camera or even right in front of it, in the picture. 
Even experiences change with photos. 
Back then you’d have to go out and see things with your own eyes. Now people can just look up photos, videos, etc. But the experience is part of it, and a photo is only .1 percent of the experience.
They are everywhere, on our phones, on tv, in grocery stores, on the subways, and pretty much surround us. We can’t be expected to not have our emotions, beliefs, memories, etc change and be shaped by this because it’s now a part of everyone’s lives, and like everything else that surrounds us, it influences us.
In the end it is something that can be used for good and bring people joy, such as connecting people and sharing with others. But it can also be used against people and do more harm than good. As with pretty much everything else in this world it can be used for reasons good or bad depending on the context and people with access to them.
It gives people a lack of reality in many ways. In basically everything we do now, we have a different view, and photos are part of the reason. 
Same as the prisoners’ reflections in caves, it's us and photos, aka a distorted reality.  </p>
 <h1>Reading 2 AI Slop</h1>
 <p>




In the article, “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” by Nesrine Malik, we see just how much AI is used today. It is not only used by people for creative or helpful things but also for political and inappropriate reasons. 
In today’s world, everyone has to be careful about what they see online because of this. It is affecting and will impact every generation. Older people are being tricked into thinking Facebook or other social media posts/news is real. The younger generations believe things that could be harmful to them. 
My generation can also be fooled by that, and there’s always people that will use things like AI for all the wrong reasons.
Like Malik says in the article, there are real pictures of real things happening that go overlooked because of this. It causes real life situations to be almost normalized. We see so many crazy things made with AI that it can desensitize people to a point of not caring as much as we all should. 
And it is not normal to have to question every single thing you see to figure out if it's real or not.
Even now, at the beginning of AI, while people are seeing the negative side, a lot of people are just amazed at what it can do and making and using it or as many things as they can. IT is a double-edged sword. Artists can use it to make art, or to improve their art but other artists can say what they work so hard on can be sort of copied or done by AI. 
Similar thing goes for musicians, film writers and producers etc. People are and should be worried that jobs could be taken eventually by the new technology and, if they are, will the job even be done as well as it is now?
While there are certain things it can be used for that would help people or even just be fun for people to use without affecting others negatively. Overall, it is scary to think about what it will become and what it is already becoming. 
How will the kids today thrive with this being normal and used everywhere and when will it get to a point where it is harming others more than helping? The algorithms being specific to you and what you like is making people believe more and more that what they see is right even if its not, and selling people more and more things that they don’t need.
I think we will have to wait and see if certain restrictions stay in place, if more restrictions are put in etc. Even if these companies have restrictions, can other people, like coders etc, with bad intentions, find a way to use these models for worse, probably. 
It is a scary thing, but the best thing people can do is educate themselves on it and be aware of what you see. Go outside and talk more to people around them and know what is happening around them and worldwide without getting too lost in social media.</p>
