 <p> In Plato’s Cave, Chapter 1, Sontag describes photography in many ways. It seems and can be a beautiful and fun thing, but it also can be used against people. 
I believe photographs can show beautiful moments and sometimes “say” more than words, but I agree that it is not really reality.
A picture can appear as many things, but the reality of the people or event in the picture you can’t really know unless you were present in that moment. Someone can see a picture and think you look the happiest you ever have when, in reality, it could have been your worst day. 
It is becoming more and more shared with social media. Many people who share their lives online would probably say that what they post is not their reality but just the best or the most curated moments of their lives.
Photographs also being used against people or in a way to hurt them is not right but is the reality of the world. People can use photos for blackmail, edit pictures into something bad, stalking, etc.
Even if you don’t consent to being in it, you can still be captured in photos, even without knowing, same as with video now.
Even for mental health, photos can be bad. Seeing vacations, experiences, people having fun, perfect bodies, and perfect lives can change people’s views completely. But people really only usually share the good things, the cute photos. Not the things that are tough and unpleasant. You wouldn’t have any way of knowing if it’s staged or candid, if there was arguing going on, or if someone just went through a tragedy.
Photos can show and make you feel a lot, but the truth is that you never really know the situation behind the camera or even right in front of it, in the picture. 
Even experiences change with photos. 
Back then you’d have to go out and see things with your own eyes. Now people can just look up photos, videos, etc. But the experience is part of it, and a photo is only .1 percent of the experience.
They are everywhere, on our phones, on tv, in grocery stores, on the subways, and pretty much surround us. We can’t be expected to not have our emotions, beliefs, memories, etc change and be shaped by this because it’s now a part of everyone’s lives, and like everything else that surrounds us, it influences us.
It gives people a lack of reality in many ways. In basically everything we do now, we have a different view, and photos are part of the reason. 
Same as the prisoners’ reflections in caves, it's us and photos, aka a distorted reality. </p>
