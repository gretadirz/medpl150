  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>For photomontage 1 I decided to do climate chnage. For the background I chose snowy mountains and layered on fire towards the bottom. 
  The fire is supposed to look like it is slowly spreading up. For the last photo I cut out a sign from a picture of a lady holding it. 
  I changhed the opacity of the fire layer so that it blended in better with the mountains and the sign.
  
  For photomontage 2 I wanted to highlight immigration and the issues surrounding deportation in the U.S. The background I did the American
  flag in a rustic style. Next the shadow of people on the bottom i cut out from a larger picture of them and used multiply. I resized them so
  that they would fit between the stripes. The group of people that are larger is a photo that was multiplied and just put behind the smaller 
  people. The last image I cut out the poster from a larger image. I added a photo of a push pin so that it looks like the poster is pinned onto 
  the flag and changed the color to match better to the flag using the saturation/hue and curve.</p>
