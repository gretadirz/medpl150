  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>For homework 5 I decided to add onto my climate change Photomontage 1 from week 4. Since in the first montage I added a lot to the
  bottom, for this homework I wanted to add the vector elements to the top. I used mainly the star shape with a similar color to the fire at the bottom
  and the red color from the letters in the sign so that there is a nice contrast.
