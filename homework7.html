  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>For homework 7 I chose to do an interior illustarted enviroment. I picked a rustic farmhouse interior because i thought the colors and shaped
  in it looked cool and I had an idea of what i wanted the colors to be. I used the shaper and direct selection tool a lot in illustrator. 
  I also used the curvature tool a lot and for every individual shape i did the color and fill. I used mainly a blue, reddish, green color triad and
  then used the different shades associated with those three.</p>
