<h1>Greta Dirzyte</h1>

<p>
Greta Dirzyte, I am an artist living in New York, originally from Long Island. I like to dabble in all sorts
of art and appreciate all forms of creative expression. I have experience working with social media and
visual content for a production company and I love making unique advertisements. I get to see a lot of the
production side of how things are made, but I also get to use my own ideas for how to advertise and
market new sections of the company. My love for film is always growing, and I would love to learn and
explore more about video production and editing. I have helped some friends who make short films, and it
has convinced me even more to learn more about what goes into the post-production. I had a taste of what
it was like setting up and shooting but not as much of the editing. I’m especially drawn to interactive
work that also connects people together and draws them to the art and each other. As a hobby, I love
painting because I can start having nothing in mind and end up with a beautiful art piece if I just let go
and let myself paint. I would like to work in marketing but am also interested in other things as mentioned
before. I want to use my artistic and creative side and incorporate it into my work for companies. I love to
see other people's work and appreciate it and know their backstory because, in the end, I think it's what
brings us together.</p>
