  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>For homework 9, I decided to do a pie graph of data about how many times a day people use the subway. I grouped it as 1,2,3, and 4 or more times.
  I figured not many people would say more than 4 so I grouped that together with 4. Most people said 2 which makes sense going point A to B once a day
  and probably walking for the rest of the day. Nobody said 3 which made sense to me. One person said 1 which seems odd because it only takes you to point B
  but how do they get back to point A. That person said they go to work on the subway but take the walk back home after work so they onlt use the subway
  once a day usually. Some people said 4 or more and those were usually people who had both work and school far from each other and far from home. I decided to
  make my colors for the graph fun so I also added a bright background for more color!
