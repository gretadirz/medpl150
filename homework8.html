  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>For homework 8, I did the eye blink with frame animation and a dancing dog also using frame animation. I picked a jack russell
  because that's the breed of dog I have! His name is Patches and he's the best so I decided it would be funny to make it look like the dog is dancing.
  I put point along the limbs and some on his head and torso so that the movements looked more precise. I changed it slightly on each layer.
  The eye blink with my eye from homework 6 didn't look good so I decided to use the files shared with the class. I made the eye lid go up and 
  down but also changed the eyeball to move slightly to the left and then back into center as it blinks.</p>
