  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>In my first image, a deep depth of field, the exit sign and everything around it is sharp and looks detailed. It still focuses on the sign and lighting of it, but the background door area and tiles add to it.
    The second image, shallow depth of field, the background is less detailed and there is even more emphasis on the sign. 
    In the third picture, field blur, the background is basically all blur, you can see almost an outline of what would be there but the main point and focus is the big glowing exit sign.
    The blur adds something to the picture but also takes away something from the original.

    The before and after images for the first photo, you don't see as much change in sharpness but the colors in the second image are way more vibrant and it seems brighter in the back and darker in the front more than the first image.
    You can see the backgrounf of trees, cars, and the lanes more clearly and it makes the image "happier" than the first one.
    In the second before and after images, you can see how much the exposure,brightness,vibrance etc, can change and highlight a photo if wanted. In the after image the buildings in the back are more pronounced, while in the before the buildings in the front show more detail. It changes the whole feeling and vibe of the picture. </p>
